Bruno Client
============

This is the client for [Bruno VoIP system](https://github.com/vhakulinen/bruno-server) and is even more WIP than the server.


Contribuing
===========

Rather than creating pull requests on this repo, open an issue. The reason for this is that there is so much stuff
to plan for the client (the biggets this is the protocol between clients). So if you have any cratzy ideas on that
one, open up an issue and tell me about it!
